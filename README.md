# 👋 Hey, I'm Richa!


I'm an experienced Data Analyst and Tableau Developer.

For over 10 years, I've helped companies solve business problems with machine learning in domains such as banking and healthcare. I see my role as helping data scientists and researchers shorten feedback loops and spend time on their business problems (instead of fussing with cloud resources).
